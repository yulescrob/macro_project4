# Simulating a DSGE Model with Dynare and Labor Market Transitions

### Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model
The purpose of this project is to simulate how the economy responds to a temporary technology shock. 
#### Replicating DSGE model
To run rbc.mod file on MATLAB, install Dynare. Then, add the path to where the Dynare file lives. For example, the command can look like _addpath('/Applications/Dynare/6.3-x86_64/matlab')_. To run the file, type in the command window _dynare rbc_.
